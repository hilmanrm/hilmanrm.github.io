I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Network and Data Science (Central European University) and a Visiting Research Fellow at Department of Urbanism (Delft University of Technology). I involve in various international collaborations, among others with UNICEF Office of Innovation (Human Mobility) and Alan Turing Institute (New Forms of Data for Mobility). Specialized in Spatial Data Science and Social Network Analysis, my works revolve around urban mobility network, urban transportation network, and urban complex system.
